### Built with

-  HTML with Handlebars
-  CSS custom properties
-  Flexbox
-  CSS Grid
-  [Webpack Init](https://github.com/Renato6GS/webpack-init) - My webpack init

### What I learned

My goal with this practice was to reinforce my knowledge of HTML and CSS with responsive design. Also, this is my first time using my "webpack init" as well as keeping a more orderly sequence of commits, thanks to the Midudev book.
